## Unit Testing
What is tested:
- Free squares no more than two squares away from a move and within the boundaries of the game board are correctly collected into a list.
- The list that contains the moves to be evaluated is updated correclty.
- If a row of five exists, it is found if a move contained in it is given.

## Manual testing
I have tested the gameplay of the AI through the GUI. A version of the evaluation function has been implemented and seems to be working.
