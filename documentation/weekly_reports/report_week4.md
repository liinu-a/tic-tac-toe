# Report week 4
I've spent most of the week figuring out a way to evaluate the game board rationally and on improving the coverage of the unit tests. I've felt a bit stuck on the board evaluation part, but I may have come up with some solution, hopefully. I additionally moved the minimax function to be a method of the AI class.

Next week the aim is to create an evaluation function for the minimax algorithm, improve the implementation document and possibly apply some other testing methods in addition to unit testing.

The time spent on the project was around 18h.
