# Report week 1
I attended the startin lecture of the course and decided on the theme of the project - implementing an AI for tic-tac-toe played on a twenty-by-twenty grid. I've been interested in AI and tought that the theme I chose could be a good introduction to it.

During the week, I've looked into the minimax algorithm and how its efficiency can be improved with alpha-beta pruning. I've also created the initial project structure and a rough base for the GUI of the game with Tkinter. I had to get an understanding of Tkinter and look up some tutorials on how the GUI could be build with it as I haven't used Tkinter before. Additionally, I wrote the required documentation. 

It is a bit difficult to fully understand how exactly the AI will be implemented but I hope it will become more clear to me as the project moves along. I also had a bit of a hard time trying to determine the time complexity of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for the project specification.

The time spent on the project was about 8-9h.
