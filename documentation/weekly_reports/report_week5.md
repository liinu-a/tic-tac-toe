# Report week 5
I left a peer review and read the peer review that was left for me. I implemented an evaluation function for the minimax algorithm. The gameplay of the AI seems to have improved but the program has significantly slowed down. It can take seconds for the AI to respond (even though the depth of minimax was decreased to 3), especially when blocking the AI from making a move that would lead it closer to winning. 

Next week I'll try to make the program run faster and focus on writing tests and documentation.

The time spent on the project was around 18h.
