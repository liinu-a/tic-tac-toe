# Report week 3
After receiving good advice and guidance from the course teacher, I have mainly focused on implementing the minimax algorithm. Even though the evaluation function for it is still under work, The AI ​​is currently able to identify and prevent some moves that would lead to the user winning. Next week I must focus on improving the test coverage and on implementing the evaluation function for the minimax algorithm.

The time spent on the project was around 18h.
